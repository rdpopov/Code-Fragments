# Code-Fragments

Code fragments that I have made that do some useful work.\
They might come in handy in the future.\
Generally pieces of code that I feel might not use in the future\
but someone else might, and I want them as easy to find as possible\
my git commit history. They are simple, but nifty.\
Enjoy!\

#Languages
- **vimscript** part of what I use(d?) in my vimconfig\
    ├── input_language_switcher.vim\

        while it does have limited selection, it is super convinient for vim
    ├── open_in_browser.vim\
        a utility to get visually selected text and .. use it in a variety of ways\
        opening it in a browser for one
